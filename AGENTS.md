# Design System

All UI work — layout, color, typography, spacing, component selection, UX behavior — must follow [`docs/STYLEGUIDE.md`](./docs/STYLEGUIDE.md). Use the tokens defined in `src/renderer/src/assets/main.css` (the canonical source) and the shadcn primitives in `src/renderer/src/components/ui/`. Don't invent new color values, font sizes, or shadow tiers when a documented one already covers the role. When STYLEGUIDE.md is silent, follow the resolution order in its final section.

## Electron UI Validation

Use the `$electron` skill and Playwright CDP for rendered Orca UI checks. Do not use computer-use for Orca UI validation.

# Style

## Reuse Before Reimplementing

Before writing new logic at any scale — a function, component, IPC channel, state store, or whole subsystem/flow — check whether an existing implementation already does the job (or nearly does). Extend or generalize it instead of building a parallel version; only write from scratch when nothing fits. Keep the check proportionate: a quick search for trivial code, a real one before building anything substantial.

## Concise/Brief Non-obvious Comments ONLY

- DO NOT: be verbose, explain the obvious, walk through the code ("WHY not HOW")
- BE CONCISE. 1 LINE if possible

## Lint Rules: Do Not Disable Max Lines

NEVER add a `max-lines` disable (`eslint-disable max-lines`, `oxlint-disable max-lines`, or line-specific variants), and never add a per-file `max-lines` bump in `mobile/.oxlintrc.json`.

## File and Module Naming

Never use vague names like `helpers`, `utils`, `common`, `misc`, or `shared-stuff` for files, folders, or modules. They carry zero info and tend to become dumping grounds. Name files after what they _actually_ contain — prefer the concrete domain concept (e.g. `tab-group-state.ts`, `terminal-orphan-cleanup.ts`) over the generic role (`tabs-helpers.ts`, `terminal-utils.ts`). If you find yourself reaching for `helpers`, the file probably has more than one responsibility and should be split, or there's a better name hiding in the code that describes what the functions operate on.

## Type Declarations: Prefer `.ts` Over `.d.ts`

# Verifying Changes

- **Typecheck**: `pnpm tc` (or `tc:node` / `tc:cli` / `tc:web`)
- **Test**: `pnpm test [path/to/file.test.ts]`
- **Lint**: `oxlint`, or `pnpm run check:code-quality:changed` for changed files (full `pnpm lint` is slow); format with `pnpm format`

# Considerations

## Worktree Safety

Always use the primary working directory (the worktree) for all file reads and edits. Never follow absolute paths from subagent results that point to the main repo.

## Cross-Platform Support

Orca targets macOS, Linux, and Windows. Keep all platform-dependent behavior behind runtime checks:

- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Never hardcode `e.metaKey`. Use a platform check (`navigator.userAgent.includes('Mac')`) to pick `metaKey` on Mac and `ctrlKey` on Linux/Windows. Electron menu accelerators should use `CmdOrCtrl`.
- **Shortcut labels in UI**: Display `⌘` / `⇧` on Mac and `Ctrl+` / `Shift+` on other platforms.
- **File paths**: Use `path.join` or Electron/Node path utilities — never assume `/` or `\`.
- **Windows setup scripts**: the setup/issue-command runner is a `.cmd` batch file unless the script starts with a `#!` line — never derive that from the user's terminal-shell preference, and never launch a `.cmd` runner with a bare `cmd.exe /c` from a Git Bash pane (MSYS rewrites the `/c`). See [`docs/reference/windows-setup-shell.md`](./docs/reference/windows-setup-shell.md).
- **Windows child processes**: start them through `runProcess`/`spawnProcess` in `src/shared/child-process/` — never `child_process` directly. It pins `windowsHide`, refuses `shell: true`, and encodes `.cmd`/`.bat` arguments so neither `CommandLineToArgvW` nor `cmd.exe` mangles them. A ratchet test fails on any new direct import.
- **Windows process enumeration**: read the table through `src/main/windows/windows-process-table.ts`, never by forking `powershell.exe`. See [`docs/reference/windows-process-enumeration.md`](./docs/reference/windows-process-enumeration.md).
- **Windows EDR signal**: don't add `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`, `-EncodedCommand`, `cmd.exe /c` with escaped free text, per-operation interpreter spawning, or runtime `Add-Type` compilation without reading [`docs/reference/windows-edr-posture.md`](./docs/reference/windows-edr-posture.md) first — behavioural EDR scores each of those, and being signed does not clear them.
- **WSL commands**: build argv with `buildWslExecArgs` (always `--exec` — under `--`, `wsl.exe` expands `$name` in every argument and silently rewrites the script), and fence anything whose stdout you parse with `buildWslCapturedLoginShellCommand`, because the interactive login shell prints the distro banner to stdout. See [`docs/reference/wsl-command-execution.md`](./docs/reference/wsl-command-execution.md).
- **Linux native modules**: keep the glibc floor at Ubuntu 20.04 / glibc 2.31. A module compiled from source on a newer runner can reference symbol versions absent on the floor and crash the app on startup. See [`docs/reference/linux-glibc-compatibility.md`](./docs/reference/linux-glibc-compatibility.md); packaging fails if a bundled native binary needs newer glibc.

## SSH Use Case

All changes must consider the SSH use case. Don't assume local-only execution. Before changing anything that reports on, stops, or lists remote work, follow [`docs/reference/ssh-execution-boundary.md`](./docs/reference/ssh-execution-boundary.md): the execution host owns everything that touches execution, and loss of contact is never evidence of process death — the verdict vocabulary is `live` / `unverifiable` / `exited`, with no synonyms.

## Folder Workspace Use Case

All changes must consider folder workspaces as well as git worktrees. Don't assume every workspace is a git worktree.

## Moving a Tab Between Workspaces

A tab can be rehomed to another workspace on the same execution host without killing its process. Before changing tab↔workspace ownership, follow [`docs/reference/tab-workspace-move.md`](./docs/reference/tab-workspace-move.md): state keyed by tab id must stay untouched, a running process keeps the working directory it was launched in and the UI must say so rather than imply it followed, and main's PTY worktree binding has to be re-keyed explicitly or the moved pane stops resolving.

## Per-Window View State

With multi-window, the project filter (`filterRepoIds` + `filterGroupIds`) belongs to a window, not the profile. Before adding UI state that must differ between windows, or touching `ui:get` / `ui:set` / `ui:stateChanged`, follow [`docs/reference/per-window-view-state.md`](./docs/reference/per-window-view-state.md): add the key to `WindowViewState` rather than special-casing a channel, keep the persisted value as the seed only the focused window rewrites, and let windowless renderers (paired web, pop-out) degrade to the implicit window. A window bound to a project group (`WindowScope`, `src/shared/window-scope.ts`) derives its view state from the group and never writes the seed; main is the authority on the scope, never the renderer's argv.

## Per-Window Session Ownership

There is one stored workspace session, and main partitions it along the window axis: a project window reads and writes the keys of its project group, the free window everything no project window is serving. Before touching `session:get` / `session:set` / `session:patch`, the startup hydration chain, or any code that writes the whole session rather than a patch, follow [`docs/reference/window-session-adoption.md`](./docs/reference/window-session-adoption.md): main resolves ownership from the window's scope and never trusts a renderer-declared list, every write is rebased onto the keys the window does not own, global fields stay with the free window, and every new field of `WorkspaceSessionState` has to be classified carry/drop.

## Remote Wire Compatibility

Clients and remote Orca servers update independently, so mixed versions are the normal state. Before changing anything a paired client and host exchange — RPC params, stream frames, or the content either side publishes over them — follow [`docs/reference/remote-wire-compatibility.md`](./docs/reference/remote-wire-compatibility.md). A new optional field is safe; a new stream opcode must be capability-negotiated because decoders drop unknown opcodes silently; and changing what the host publishes reaches old clients even with no wire change.

## Git Binary Compatibility

Orca runs the user's Git binary on native, WSL, and SSH hosts, which may all have different versions. Treat Git 2.25 as the core-workflow baseline and follow [`docs/reference/git-compatibility.md`](./docs/reference/git-compatibility.md).

When adding or changing a Git command:

- Check when every subcommand and option was introduced. For newer behavior, keep a baseline-compatible fallback or degrade safely.
- Use `GitCapabilityCache` with a narrow unsupported-error predicate so recurring operations do not retry a known-invalid command. Do not rely only on `git --version`; wrappers such as `simple-git` do not remove host-version differences.
- Scope capability state to the host that executes Git: native, WSL distro, SSH provider, or relay connection. Cover the first fallback, later cached calls, concurrent probes, and relevant host isolation in tests.
- Keep the real-binary compatibility contract in PR CI current. When adopting a newer Git feature, add its version boundary so the preferred command and fallback both run against representative Git releases.
- Preserve commands that begin with global Git options such as `-c` before the subcommand, including auto-maintenance suppression used by worktree-create fetches.

## Git Scan Safety

- Never enumerate every ref and then run `git ls-tree -r` or `git show` once per ref. That ref × tree fan-out can retain gigabytes of output before a downstream `sort -u` or search can make progress.
- Prefer `rg` over the checked-out files for source searches. For history or refs, use a named ref, an explicit namespace/path, `--max-count`, and a bounded output; do not use an unqualified `--all` scan as a first diagnostic.
- Keep repository-wide commands targeted to the current repository and worktree. If an unbounded scan is genuinely required, measure the ref count first, explain the cost, and get confirmation before running it.

## Git Provider Compatibility

Source-control and review changes must consider GitLab and other supported git providers, not only GitHub. Keep provider-specific behavior behind explicit checks, and avoid GitHub-only naming for generic review concepts.

## GitHub CLI Usage

Be mindful of the user's `gh` CLI API rate limit — batch requests where possible and avoid unnecessary calls. All code, commands, and scripts must be compatible with macOS, Linux, and Windows.
